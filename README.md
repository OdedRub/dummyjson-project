# Example API project

This Python script uses the dummyjson website (https://dummyjson.com/) to retrieve data using API requests.
The user can choose to view one of three different data types - products, users or carts.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the script file (`dummyjson-api.py`).

2. Install the `requests` library if it's not already installed, using `pip install requests` command.

3. Run the script using `python3 dummyjson-api.py` command.

4. Follow the on-screen prompts to select the data type and the corresponding ID in order to retrieve the requested data (prints on screen).
